### Project Summary

This project detects offensive phrases in texts. The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle platform and carefully cleaned and processed until it fit the requirements of the model

### Technologies and Tools UsedDetect Offensive Expressions 
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, nltk

Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

Other Tools: CircleCI for CICD Pipeline

### Key Skills and Methods

The project encompasses various stages of data science workflow, including:

Data Ingestion: Efficiently loading and handling data to prepare for analysis and modeling.

Data Cleaning: Text data has been cleaned and the unbalanced data set problem has been resolved.

Model Training: The project used a sequential model based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to successfully perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability and accuracy.
